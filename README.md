# Sonneteer

![ScreenShot](public/images/ScreenShot.png)

Sonneteer generates poems! Users choose their own rhyme scheme and line lengths, then press 'Generate' and hey presto, a readymade literary masterwork appears onscreen.

The app is built with Node.js, Express and these libraries: [Rhymes](https://github.com/words/rhymes), [Syllable](https://www.npmjs.com/package/syllable) and [Random-Words](https://www.npmjs.com/package/random-words). 

Sonneteer is deployed to [Heroku](https://sonneteer.herokuapp.com/).
To run it locally, clone the repo, `npm install`, `npm start` and navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).
Tests are written with Mocha and Chai. To run them use the `npm run test` command.
